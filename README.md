# VBA-Challenge
Homework assignment involving code for VBA

## Repository Description
This repository includes three screenshots of the results of running my VBA script with excel macros for stocks.

This repository also includes a vbs file that displays the VBA code I wrote in order to calculate changes in certain stocks along with their total volume for a given year.

In addition stocks with the greatest percent increase and decrease, as well as highest volume are displayed for each year.

### Code Sources
I did recieve some code snippets and code help from a tutor in order to help fix my orginal code I had written, but most of the code is mine. All of the code can be found in the .vbs file in this repository.
